## Skills

**Self motivated**
Before the course was even over I started my first personal projects. One was client directed: my partner wanted an easier way to download images for her work at a film festival. For her I built a Chrome extension that when clicked shows all images from a page and their respective sizes. For myself I am building one that when clicked will find all images on a page that have face in them and draws a silly mustache on them.

**Team Player**
Perhaps my favourite aspects of Makers Academy was the focus on collaboration. Several times during the course I helped my pair partners to take a step back and remember their goals by discussing with them what exactly they wanted to learn this week and how they could get that knowledge. This of course also helped me remember mine.

**Quick Study**
For my final project at Makers, I worked with a team of four on building an app in Swift, a language none of us had ever even looked at before and which even the coaches were unfamiliar with. Through focussed research and experimentation, explaining my findings to my team members and integrating their findings with my own I guided our team to the successful completion of our app in under ten days.

## Education
**Makers Academy (June 2018 to September 2018)**

A 16-week intensive development bootcamp, where I learned how to solve problems as a programmer, including (among MANY other things) how to break down problems, how to test drive code, how to keep code DRY, how to build with objects, how the web works and how to use APIs. But more importantly I learned how to learn effectively so can keep adding to that list.

An undergraduate level course in illustration, where I learned how to communicate ideas visually, how to manage my time to effectively to meet deadlines and how to grow my creative muscle.
