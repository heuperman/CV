### Experience

**Barista, Ottolenghi (July 2014 to June 2018)**

*Islington branch of renowned chef Yotam Ottolenghi’s restaurants.*

Responsible for providing consistent world class service and making coffees that match the high quality of the food served. Included working with natural wines.
Required extensive and efficient communication with other floor staff as well as management and kitchen staff. 
Involved regular inventory checks, maintaining stock levels in bar, keeping work area clean at all times and maintaining equipment.


**Shipping Coordinator, Cheeky Tiki (July 2011 to June 2014)**

*Interior design and bespoke barware for tropical and themed bars.*

Responsible for overseeing all facets of the shipping process of Cheeky Tiki’s varied range of bespoke products, managing the order fulfilment and transportation cycle from start to finish, making sure established deadlines and both domestic and international deliveries were successfully completed. 

This would often include managing both incoming and outgoing large overseas shipments and organizing urgent, bespoke requests for products at short notice. Rigorous quality control and efficient stock management were fundamental to this role - I was in charge of taking a full, regular inventory of the flagship warehouse’s incoming and outgoing stock, spanning two stories, and making sure capacity was kept at optimal levels and highly organised.

This would also include periodic workflow assessments to consistently streamline the process and required maintaining both precise attention to detail and seamless communication with my team, including an assistant I would oversee the training and workload of.
