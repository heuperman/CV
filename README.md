## Education
**Makers Academy (June 2018 - September 2018)**

A 16-week intensive development bootcamp, where I learned how to solve problems as a programmer, including (among MANY other things) how to break down problems, how to test drive code, how to keep code DRY, how to build with objects, how the web works and how to use APIs. But more importantly I learned how to learn effectively so can keep adding to that list.

**HKU College of Arts Utrecht, Netherlands (August 2008 - December 2010)**

An undergraduate level course in illustration, where I learned how to communicate ideas visually, how to manage my time to effectively to meet deadlines and how to grow my creative muscle.

## Interests
All kinds of making: painting, drawing, bike building, bookbinding, woodworking and of course software development.
