## Skills

**Self motivated**   
Iâ€™m always eager to learn and develop myself with new challenges. At Rezonence, we have made extensive use of the Angular framework, which I was previously unfamiliar with. In my evenings, I built an incremental game to teach myself the basics of Angular while also creating something fun I could share with others. Many of the things I learned and worked through there I would later use to solve problems at work.

**Team Player**   
I highly value the collaborative process and benefits of working in a close-knit team. I am always keen to review pull requests and lead stand-ups. I am proactive in asking to be involved in a story if I know I might benefit from a deeper understanding of a specific topic, as well as inviting and including others to reciprocate skill-sharing.

**Quick Study**  
For my final project at Makers, I worked with a team of four on building an app in Swift, a language none of us had ever even looked at before and which even the coaches were unfamiliar with. Through focussed research and experimentation, explaining my findings to my team members and integrating their findings with my own I guided our team to the successful completion of our app in under ten days.
